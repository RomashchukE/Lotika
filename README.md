A couple of years ago, I completed several courses in test automation. 
I tried to apply it in practice, but unfortunately, on my projects, the management highly valued my manual contribution to testing new features and did not allocate resources for my development in test automation. 
I hope it wasn't all for nothing and that someone special will notice me and help me develop further in this direction.
